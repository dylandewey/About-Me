This assignment was tough for me.  I initially started making the pages from scratch using only columns and rows.  I used this for the Navbar and everything else.  Then when people started asking questions about the homework, I saw they were using much more than just columns and rows from bootstrap.  So I made some major changes and incorporated more Bootstrap.  It was quite overwhelming and frustrating.  I then met with a tutor who gave me even more tips on ways I can use Bootstrap and best practices.  After I met with the tutor and many hours spent with my group I feel much more comfortable with Bootstrap and not as overwhelmed and discouraged.  

## About Me
This is the page I started using all columns and rows from Bootstrap.  I had everything done except the footer.  Then I had to change to use more Bootstrap including the navbar.  It worked much better.  However, I had a hard time getting the text to wrap around the image when the screen was smaller.  I finally got it to work by putting the text and the image in the same column and have the image float-left.

## Portfolio
On this page I had the hardest time getting the 5 images to show up on the page how I wanted them.  They were coming up in all different sizes and all over the page.  I finally got them in place by giving each column class a float-left.  
#### Captions
My next issue was getting the caption on the images.  I was going to not even do it and just leave the images.  But then my tutor helped me discover the figcaption class!  So I added the figure caption using that from Bootstrap then did some formatting changes to get it to look right in CSS.

## Contact
My group was a huge help on this page.  They told me about the forms in bootstrap so I found the one that looked like it would work and put it in the html and made the changes necessary to make it look right.  It still doesn't have functionality for what it should do but that will come later.  I was just focused on making it look like it was supposed to.

## Conclusion
It was cool to learn some of the tricks using Bootstrap.  Some of the formatting techniques you can put right inside the classes in the html file work great and make it easier than putting them in the separate css file.  I still have so much to learn about what Bootstrap has to offer.  I think it will definitly be a valuable tool in the future.
